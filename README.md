Crypto arbitrage bot

## goal
Create a bot that can trade arbitrage opportunities on coinbase-pro. Inspired by this article https://forum.gekko.wizb.it/thread-56746-post-57937.html. My primary intention for creating this project was to make an actual profit, but in hindsight it has mostly been a (great!) learning experience and should not be taken too seriously :).

## Implementation
The backend folder contains the implementation for the bot. It currently can gather data to look for arbitrage opportunities for any pair traded on coinbase-pro. Live trading features have also been implemented but never properly been tested, so unexpected behaviours are to be expected. Frontend has not been implemented, program runs in console.
